# Wordle
Terminal-based clone of the popular game "Wordle", which you can play endlessly... (not just 1 wordle per day)
- No python required to run: the final app you see in the releases is a standalone UNIX executable which includes the relevant python libraries required to run the game
- Features a keyboard graphic which updates according to the tile colours, allowing to track guessed and not-guessed letters, like the real game

Installation:
1. Download and extract 'wordle.zip' from the releases
2. Open the UNIX executable
3. If you get the following notification: "wordle" can't be opened because the identity of the developer cannot be confirmed, open with Ctrl+Click (right click) --> Open (You only need to do this the first time you open the app)
